    <h1>BHAN GARH FORT
    </h1>
    <p>
       Bhangarh Fort, located in the Alwar district of Rajasthan, is renowned as one of Indiaâ€™s most haunted sites. Constructed in 1573 by Raja Madho Singh I, the younger brother of Man Singh of Amber, the fort was built for his younger son. Situated at the edge of the Sariska Tiger Reserve, it stands amidst the Aravalli hills, offering a glimpse into the region's rich history and architecture.

The fort's eerie reputation stems from various legends and tales of paranormal activities. Local folklore narrates stories of a curse placed upon the fort, leading to its eventual ruin. Consequently, the Archaeological Survey of India has prohibited entry after sunset and before sunrise.

Despite its haunted reputation, Bhangarh Fort attracts numerous visitors intrigued by its mysterious allure and historical significance. The fort's architectural remnants, including temples and havelis, offer insights into the grandeur of the bygone era.
