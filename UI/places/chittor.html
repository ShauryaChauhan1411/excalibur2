    <h1>CHITTORGARH FORT
    </h1>
    <p>
        Discover the timeless grandeur of Chittorgarh Fort — a breathtaking symbol of Rajput pride, courage, and heritage in Rajasthan. Sprawled across 700 acres and perched dramatically on a 180-meter-high hill, this 7th-century fortress is one of Asia’s largest. Once the glorious capital of the Mewar Kingdom, it boasts seven majestic gateways (“Pols”), exquisite palaces, ancient temples, and serene water reservoirs.

A must-see highlight is the stunning Vijay Stambh (Tower of Victory), a 37-meter structure offering panoramic views of the fort. Equally captivating is the Kirti Stambh (Tower of Fame) and the legendary Rani Padmini Palace, surrounded by a tranquil lotus pool.

The fort is steeped in dramatic history, having endured three epic sieges, including one by Alauddin Khilji in 1303, and is forever linked to the bravery of Rani Padmini and the fateful Jauhar. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Chittorgarh is a must-visit for history lovers, culture seekers, and anyone looking to experience Rajasthan’s royal legacy.
