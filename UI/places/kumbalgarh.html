    <h1>KUMBALGARH FORT
    </h1>
    <p>
        Step into the majestic world of Kumbhalgarh Fort — a stunning hilltop fortress nestled in the Aravalli ranges of Rajasthan. Built in the 15th century by the legendary ruler Rana Kumbha, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is famed for its massive defensive wall stretching over 36 km — the second longest in the world after the Great Wall of China.

Set at an elevation of 1,100 meters, the fort offers breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding forests and hills. Within its imposing walls lie over 300 temples, grand palaces, step wells, and water reservoirs. Don’t miss the beautiful Badal Mahal (Palace of Clouds), perched at the fort’s highest point, offering spectacular sunset vistas.

Kumbhalgarh also holds great historical importance as the birthplace of the legendary warrior Maharana Pratap. A perfect destination for history buffs and adventure seekers, the fort’s sheer scale and architectural brilliance make it one of Rajasthan’s most unforgettable travel experiences.
