    <h1>HAWA MAHAL</h1>
    <p>
Experience the elegance of Hawa Mahal — one of the most iconic landmarks of Jaipur, the “Pink City” of Rajasthan. Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, this architectural marvel is renowned for its stunning five-story façade featuring 953 intricately carved jharokhas (windows). Made of red and pink sandstone, the palace was designed to resemble the crown of Krishna.

The name “Hawa Mahal,” or “Palace of Winds,” comes from its clever design that allows cool breezes to flow through the structure, keeping it airy even during Rajasthan’s hot summers. Historically, it was built so royal women could observe street festivities and processions without being seen.

Located in the heart of Jaipur’s old city, it offers stunning views of the bustling bazaars below and City Palace, Jaipur. A perfect blend of history, architecture, and culture, Hawa Mahal is a must-visit for travelers exploring Rajasthan’s royal heritage.</p>
