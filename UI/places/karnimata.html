    <h1>KARNI MATA TEMPLE
    </h1>
    <p>

Karni Mata Temple is a unique and revered Hindu temple located in Deshnok, near Bikaner, Rajasthan, India, dedicated to Goddess Karni Mata, an incarnation of Goddess Durga. The temple is famously known as the “Rat Temple” because it houses thousands of black rats (kabbas), considered sacred and believed to be reincarnated devotees of the goddess.

The temple architecture showcases traditional Rajasthani style, with marble floors, silver doors, and beautifully carved idols. Visitors can observe the rats freely roaming around the temple, and feeding or offering sweets to them is considered highly auspicious.

Karni Mata Temple attracts thousands of pilgrims, especially during festivals like Navratri, and offers a rare cultural experience blending faith, folklore, and local traditions. The temple is a must-visit for those seeking spiritual insight, photography opportunities, and an extraordinary glimpse into Rajasthan’s unique religious heritage.
