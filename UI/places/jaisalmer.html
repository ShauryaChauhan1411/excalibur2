    <h1>JAISALMER FORT
    </h1>
    <p>
    
Step into a golden wonder at Jaisalmer Fort, one of the most enchanting landmarks in Rajasthan. Rising majestically from the heart of the Thar Desert, this 12th-century fortress, built by Rawal Jaisal in 1156, is famously known as the “Golden Fort” or Sonar Quila due to its honey-colored sandstone that glows at sunrise and sunset.

Unlike most forts, Jaisalmer Fort is a living fort — home to thousands of residents, bustling markets, havelis, temples, and charming cafés. Its massive yellow sandstone walls house stunning Rajput architecture, including intricately carved balconies, winding alleys, and ornate Jain temples.

The fort has witnessed centuries of trade, battles, and royal grandeur, serving as a strategic outpost on the ancient Silk Route. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it offers stunning panoramic views of the golden city below, making it a must-visit for travelers seeking history, culture, and unforgettable desert charm.
