    <h1>RANTHAMBORE NATIONAL PARK
    </h1>
    <p>
        Embark on an unforgettable wilderness adventure at Ranthambore National Park — one of India’s most famous wildlife reserves, located in Rajasthan. Spanning over 1,300 square kilometers, this spectacular park was once the royal hunting ground of the Maharajas of Jaipur. Today, it is a premier destination for spotting majestic Bengal tiger in its natural habitat.

The park’s landscape is a stunning blend of dense forests, open meadows, serene lakes, and rugged hills, with the ancient Ranthambore Fort standing tall as a dramatic backdrop. Alongside tigers, visitors may encounter leopards, sloth bears, sambar deer, crocodiles, and a wide variety of birds, making it a paradise for wildlife lovers and photographers.

Guided jeep and canter safaris offer thrilling opportunities to explore the park’s rich biodiversity. Best visited between October and June, Ranthambore National Park is the perfect escape for travelers seeking nature, adventure, and a glimpse of India’s untamed beauty.
