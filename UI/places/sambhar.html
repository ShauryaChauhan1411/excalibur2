Sambar Salt Lake is located in Sambhar, Rajasthan, India, and is the largest inland saltwater lake in the country. Spanning over 230 square kilometers, it is a unique natural and ecological wonder of Rajasthan, surrounded by arid landscapes and the Aravalli hills.

The lake is famous for salt production and is dotted with salt pans where salt is harvested during dry seasons. It also serves as a habitat for numerous migratory birds, including flamingos, pelicans, and storks, making it a haven for birdwatchers and nature enthusiasts. The reflective waters, especially at sunrise and sunset, create spectacular photography opportunities.

Visitors can explore the surrounding rural landscapes, enjoy birdwatching tours, and learn about traditional salt-making methods from local communities. Sambhar Salt Lake is a must-visit for travelers seeking natural beauty, wildlife experiences, and a glimpse into Rajasthanâ€™s unique ecological and cultural heritage.
