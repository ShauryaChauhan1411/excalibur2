Discover the wonders of science and heritage at Jantar Mantar, Jaipur — a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most fascinating attractions in Jaipur, Rajasthan. Built in 1734 by the visionary ruler Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, this remarkable observatory is a masterpiece of astronomical innovation.

Jantar Mantar houses 19 giant instruments made of stone and marble, designed to measure celestial positions with stunning accuracy. The most impressive structure is the Samrat Yantra — the world’s largest stone sundial, capable of calculating time to within seconds. Other instruments were built to predict eclipses, track stars, and determine planetary movements.

Blending scientific precision with architectural beauty, this site reflects India’s advanced understanding of astronomy centuries ago. A visit to Jantar Mantar is a must for travelers interested in history, science, and culture — an extraordinary journey through time and space.
