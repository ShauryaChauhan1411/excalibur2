    <h1>EKLING JI TEMPLE
    </h1>
    <p>
Shri Ekling Ji Temple is a famous Hindu temple complex located in Udaipur, Rajasthan, India, dedicated to Lord Shiva, worshipped here as Ekling Ji. The temple holds immense religious significance for the Mewar royal family and devotees across India. Believed to have been originally built in the 8th century and renovated multiple times, the temple today reflects exquisite Rajput architecture with intricate carvings, towering spires, and beautifully sculpted pillars.

The main sanctum houses the black stone idol of Lord Ekling Ji, and several smaller shrines within the complex honor other deities, including Lord Ganesha, Vishnu, and Mahadev. The templeâ€™s serene surroundings, well-maintained courtyards, and traditional rituals create a spiritually uplifting atmosphere.

Visitors can witness daily aarti ceremonies, festivals like Mahashivratri in grand celebration, and experience the rich religious heritage of Mewar. Shri Ekling Ji Temple is a must-visit for pilgrims, history enthusiasts, and travelers seeking cultural and spiritual insight into Rajasthan.
